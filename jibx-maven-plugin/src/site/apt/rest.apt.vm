RESTful JiBX web service example

 Instructions on building and running a JiBX web service example using Apache CXF and Apache ServiceMix.
 
 You can find this web service sample {{{https://github.com/jibx/maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/cxf-jaxrs}here}} in our source repository. This example is very similar
 to the cxf REST web service example in the servicemix distribution.
 
* Running this example

 Step 1: Download {{{http://servicemix.apache.org/}Apache servicemix}} and start it running.
 
+-----+
 bin/servicemix
+-----+

 Step 2: Install the bundles and start the example running.

+-----+
  install mvn:org.jibx/jibx-run/${project.version}
  install mvn:org.jibx.test.examples/org.jibx.examples.cxf.rs/${project.version}
  
  Note: There is a bug in karaf, so you will have to restart the server to get this working:
  (ctrl-d)
  bin/(your karaf server name)
  start xxx  (where xxx is the pid number of cxf-jaxrs)
+-----+

 Step 4: Install the test bundle and run it.
  
+-----+
 install -s mvn:org.jibx.test.examples/org.jibx.examples.cxf.rs/${project.version}
+-----+
